1 
00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:4,600 
 The best way to start a one minute speech is by directly getting to the point. 

2 
00:00:4,600 --> 00:00:6,000 
 Just like we did in this video. 

3 
00:00:6,000 --> 00:00:10,600 
 Now, in a lot longer speeches, you'd usually want to start with a better hook to grip your 

4 
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,400 
 audience in, like using a prop or an intriguing question. 

5 
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,900 
 But in a one minute speech, we don't really need to do that. 

6 
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,400 
 The idea of having a strong introduction for longer speeches is simply because the audience's 

7 
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,900 
 attention is at its peak at that period. 

8 
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,800 
 So the more curious we can make them, the higher chance we have them of getting engaged 

9 
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,100 
 through the rest of our speech. 

10 
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,400 
 But in a 60 second speech, we don't have so much time. 

11 
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,500 
 Plus, because of the short length of the speech, audience just has much less time to actually 

12 
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,200 
 zone out. 

13 
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,200 
 So getting to the point would be the best way to begin. 

14 
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,500 
 And you can use the P3F framework. 

15 
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,400 
 It stands for point, past, present, and future. 

16 
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,300 
 For example, if you were asked to give a one minute speech on your thoughts on any issue, 

17 
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,900 
 let's say your thoughts on an issue like climate change, start off by simply saying, 

18 
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,500 
 I believe that climate change is a really pressing problem in today's world. 

19 
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,200 
 Directly starting off with your main point. 

20 
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:2,000 
 Let me talk a little bit about the history of climate change. 

21 
00:01:2,000 --> 00:01:7,300 
 Evidence has found that traces of global warming go all the way back to the 1900s. 

22 
00:01:7,300 --> 00:01:12,000 
 Our footprints can be seen because of the droughts and floods that were formed back in that period. 

23 
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,400 
 Let me focus on the present. 

24 
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,100 
 Currently, climate change has taken a very dark dawn. 

25 
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,300 
 The global temperatures are rising, the ice sheets are melting, and the oceans are getting warmer 

26 
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,000 
 because of the rapid technological innovations and massive population growth. 

27 
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,400 
 We're not being able to see how badly we are really affecting the Earth. 

28 
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,800 
 Finally, we move on to the future. 

29 
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,100 
 If we continue down this path and do not change the way we approach global warming and climate change, 

30 
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,100 
 and to take a real effort to reduce the harmful effects on Earth, 

31 
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,500 
 we might be digging the grave of our own species. 

32 
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,600 
 And that's how it can be done. 

33 
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,000 
 Forget the content of the speech. 

34 
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,800 
 It doesn't matter if you agree with it or not. 

35 
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,000 
 It simply gives you a framework for one minute speeches. 

36 
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,800 
 I know I didn't exactly speak for one minute, 

37 
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,900 
 but the point is that on any of the parts of past, present, or future, 

38 
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,200 
 you can expand upon them as much as you like. 

39 
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:1,600 
 Just remember, start with your main point, move on to the rest of your speech. 

40 
00:02:1,600 --> 00:02:6,000 
 One mistake that we see a lot of people make is that when they go to deliver their one-minute speech, 

41 
00:02:6,000 --> 00:02:7,000 
 they start off with, 

42 
00:02:7,000 --> 00:02:11,400 
 Good morning, my name is Hardeep, and I'm here to talk to you about climate change. 

43 
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,500 
 Keep in mind that that's only important to do if you haven't been introduced already. 

44 
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,800 
 A lot of people, after getting introduced, 

45 
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,600 
 their name and the topic they're speaking on has been said, 

46 
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,200 
 they come on stage and they'll repeat that, which is not really required. 

47 
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,900 
 So bear in mind if you're introduced or not introduced, 

48 
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,900 
 and start your speech accordingly by directly jumping into the point. 

49 
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,000
